# Mastering Cloud Cost Control with OCI Log Analytics #

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides several built-in tools to
help users monitor, analyze, and control cloud spending. Among these
tools are OCI Cost Analysis and Scheduled Reports, which offer
visibility into usage patterns and cost trends over time. These tools
are valuable for high-level reporting and day-to-day cost tracking,
especially when trying to stay within budget or identify cost anomalies.

However, for more in-depth analysis—such as breaking down spending
across departments, correlating costs with specific resource tags, or
building custom dashboards—access to raw cost and usage data becomes
essential. This is where the ability to export and analyze detailed cost
reports becomes particularly useful.

OCI is fully compliant with the FinOps Foundation’s FOCUS (FinOps Open
Cost and Usage Specification) standard. The FOCUS report provides a
standardized and comprehensive dataset that includes detailed
information about costs, services, compartments, tags, and more. This
standardized format makes it easier to integrate OCI cost data into
third-party tools or advanced analytics platforms.

In this article, I will walk you through the process of importing a
FOCUS report into OCI Log Analytics. By doing this, you can take
advantage of powerful querying capabilities and visualization features
within the Log Analytics platform. This approach allows you to build
customized dashboards, run advanced queries, and perform granular
analysis tailored to your organization’s specific needs.

Whether you're aiming to implement FinOps best practices, provide cost
transparency to internal stakeholders, or simply gain a better
understanding of your cloud expenses, integrating FOCUS data into Log
Analytics can help you unlock new levels of insight and control.

An example of a custom dashboard could include the ability to drill down
into specific compartments, offering a clear and detailed view of the
services being used and their associated consumption. This level of
insight enables teams to identify which services are contributing most
to overall costs, uncover underutilized or idle resources, and
understand usage trends over time. As a result, it becomes significantly
easier to make informed decisions that support cost optimization
strategies, improve budget forecasting, and ultimately lead to
meaningful cost savings across the organization.

Creating custom dashboards in OCI Log Analytics is extremely
straightforward, thanks to its flexible query and visualization
capabilities. You can tailor these dashboards to meet your specific
FinOps needs, whether you're tracking costs by compartment, service, or
tag.

You can set up specific alerts for example, for usage overages. These
alerts can trigger actions such as sending an email, reducing resource
limits, or even shutting down services.

Additionally, the approach is not limited to Oracle Cloud—Log Analytics
can be extended to ingest data from other cloud providers as well. This
makes it possible to build a unified, cross-cloud FinOps dashboard that
consolidates cost and usage data from multiple environments into a
single, personalized view.

## Architecture

<img src="./images/image3.png"
style="width:4.5in;height:1.85347in" />

Fig. 3 - The architecture

Consumption information is reported in the FOCUS report, which resides
on the internal Oracle tenant.

Each day, a function retrieves this report and creates a copy in the
Cost\_Usage\_Report. As soon as the report is created, an event is
triggered, and the data is imported into Logging Analytics using a
specific FOCUS Log Source.

Once ingested, the data feeds into the FinOps dashboard and can
eventually trigger alerts.

These alerts use a specific Notification Channel, where the associated
action is defined. The action can be sending an email or triggering a
function to perform a custom remediation action.

*Create an Object Storage in your tenant*

In the OCI Console, under "Storage", click on "Object Storage" → then
"Buckets". Choose the compartment where you want to create the bucket.

Fig 4 - Bucket creation

After you create it, note the bucket namespace, name, and URL—you’ll
need these for uploading or referencing objects via APIs, CLI, or
automation tools.

*Set up IAM policies*

Create a Dynamic Group for function and Log Analytics Object rule

Create a policy with the follow statement

dg-fn-copy-CUR-reports dynamic group matching rule
```
ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = '&lt;finOps
compartment OCID&gt;’}
```
LogAnalyticsObjectCollectionRule dynamic group matching rule
```
ALL {resource.type='loganalyticsobjectcollectionrule',
resource.compartment.id = '&lt;finOps compartment OCID&gt;’}
```
Policy Statements
```
define tenancy usage-report as
